# Brick Roadmap

## App Store push 2026-10-04 (paused, resume at home)
- [ ] ASC record creation paused. Apple's web sign-in returned 503 at 13:07 and 13:32 (no verification code). Resume after 14:32 (one hour throttle window). Joshua runs asc-login at home, then asc web apps create for com.nulljosh.brick named Brick. iPhone IPA built, signed, ready to export and upload.
- [ ] RentCast API key pending Joshua signup (US sale and rent data feeds already wired, APIFY_TOKEN for HousingFeed 30 countries already configured).

## Live now 2026-10-04
- [x] Renamed from Roost to Brick (GitHub nulljosh/brick, brick.heyitsmejosh.com).
- [x] Landing page deployed with 27-second promo video, feature cards, honest copy.
- [x] iPhone app built, signed, Liquid Glass sheet map, deal scoring by percent under median.
- [x] Desktop app (tui/) and Android built in CI, tests green.
- [x] Live listings from HousingFeed and RentCast via /api/listings, 24h KV cache.
- [x] AI mode turns plain words to filters (Workers AI llama-3.3-70b with rules fallback).

## Worldwide build 2026-08-28
Web app now browses anywhere on earth: Nominatim place search, real local street
names from Overpass, per-country currency/units/price levels, sale and rent
modes, and UI strings in 25 languages with RTL.

- [ ] Hero line translatable into all 26 languages (currently English-only on landing).
- [ ] Login/Register/ForgotPassword copy localization (strings dict has keys, pages need `t()` calls).
- [x] Landing pitch translated into all 26 languages (2026-09-06).
- [x] Live listings replace generated inventory (2026-10-04).

## Polish and optimization

- [ ] No land check on generated coordinates. Street anchors are on land by
      construction, but the no-streets fallback can still put a home in water.
- [ ] Service worker serves the previous build for one load after a deploy.
      Every check of a fresh deploy needs a hard reload or an unregister first.
- [ ] JS bundle split: Leaflet loads on landing where no map exists. Route-level code splitting wanted.
- [ ] `npm test` runs two node files. No CI runs them.

## TUI pilot (2026-09-05)
- `roost-tui` SwiftPM target (SwiftTUI). `swift build && ./.build/debug/roost-tui "Vancouver"` hits Nominatim directly, same public geocoding API src/lib/geo.js calls. Needs a real TTY.

## 2026-09-10 loading cleanup

Removed the unused animate.css import and dependency. App routes load on demand; Leaflet CSS travels with the map. The main JavaScript bundle is 437 kB, with the 162 kB listings bundle separate. Build and both test suites pass. Existing test CI was verified in .github/workflows/test.yml.

## From Notes (2026-09-12)
- [ ] Sync UI/color palette more with portfolio and other projects
